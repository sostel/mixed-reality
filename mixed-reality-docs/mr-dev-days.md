# Mixed Reality Dev Days

Applications are currently closed. Thanks for your interest!

With the [announcements](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/02/24/microsoft-at-mwc-barcelona-introducing-microsoft-hololens-2/) Microsoft recently made in the mixed reality and cloud space, we’re thrilled to open applications for **Mixed Reality Dev Days**, a chance to build the skills, network, and ideas you need to take your mixed reality applications to the next level. Mixed Reality Dev Days will offer attendees a chance to code alongside our engineering teams, learn and test the latest in our portfolio, and connect with a community of developers like you who are leading a new era of mixed reality applications.  </br>

We’ll also hold [sessions](mr-dev-days-sessions.md) led by our teams to dive deeper on what’s new and share tips for getting started. </br>

Our tentative list of sessions can be found [here](mr-dev-days-sessions.md).

Attendees will also have a chance to get hands-on with our technology both in our hands-on labs and our demo stations.
