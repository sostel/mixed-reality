The Windows Device Portal for HoloLens lets you configure and manage your device remotely over Wi-Fi or USB. The Device Portal is a web server on your HoloLens that you can connect to from a web browser on your PC. The Device Portal includes many tools that will help you manage your HoloLens and debug and optimize your apps.

This documentation is specifically about the Windows Device Portal for HoloLens. To use the Windows Device portal for desktop (including for Windows Mixed Reality), see [Windows Device Portal overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal)

## Setting up HoloLens to use Windows Device Portal

1. Power on your HoloLens and put on the device.
2. Perform the [bloom](gestures.md#bloom) gesture to launch the main menu.
3. Gaze at the **Settings** tile and perform the [air-tap](gestures.md#air-tap) gesture. Perform a second air-tap to place the app in your environment. The Settings app will launch after you place it.
4. Select the **Update** menu item.
5. Select the **For developers** menu item.
6. Enable **Developer Mode**.
7. [Scroll down](gestures.md#composite-gestures) and enable **Device Portal**.
8. If you are setting up Windows Device Portal so you can deploy apps to this HoloLens over USB or Wi-Fi, click **Pair** to [generate a pairing PIN](using-visual-studio.md). Leave the Settings app at the PIN popup until you enter the PIN into Visual Studio during your first deployment.

## Connecting over Wi-Fi

1. [Connect your HoloLens to Wi-Fi](connecting-to-wi-fi-on-hololens.md).
2. Look up your device's IP address.
   * Find the IP address on the device under **Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > Advanced Options**.
3. From a web browser on your PC, go to https://<YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>
   * The browser will display the following message: "There’s a problem with this website’s security certificate". This happens because the certificate which is issued to the Device Portal is a test certificate. You can ignore this certificate error for now and proceed.

## Connecting over USB

1. [Install the tools](install-the-tools.md) to make sure you have Visual Studio Update 1 with the Windows 10 developer tools installed on your PC. This enables USB connectivity.
2. Connect your HoloLens to your PC with a micro-USB cable.
3. From a web browser on your PC, go to http://127.0.0.1:10080.

## Connecting to an emulator

You can also use the Device Portal with your emulator. To connect to the Device Portal, use the [toolbar](using-the-hololens-emulator.md). Click on this icon:
![Open Device Portal icon](images/emulator-deviceportal.png) **Open Device Portal**: Open the Windows Device Portal for the HoloLens OS in the emulator.

## Creating a Username and Password

![Set up access to Windows Device Portal](images/windows-device-portal-credentials-reset-page-1000px.png)<br>
*Set up access to Windows Device Portal*

The first time you connect to the Device Portal on your HoloLens, you will need to create a username and password.
1. In a web browser on your PC, enter the IP address of the HoloLens. The Set up access page opens.
2. Click or tap **Request pin** and look at the HoloLens display to get the generated PIN.
3. Enter the PIN in the **PIN displayed on your device** textbox.
4. Enter the user name you will use to connect to the Device Portal. It doesn't need to be a Microsoft Account (MSA) name or a domain name.
5. Enter a password and confirm it. The password must be at least seven characters in length. It doesn't need to be an MSA or domain password.
6. Click **Pair** to connect to Windows Device Portal on the HoloLens.

If you wish to change this username or password at any time, you can repeat this process by visiting the device security page by either clicking the **Security** link along the top right, or navigating to: https://<YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>/devicesecurity.htm.

## Security certificate

If you are see a "certificate error" in your browser, you can fix it by creating a trust relationship with the device.

Each HoloLens generates a unique self-signed certificate for its SSL connection. By default, this certificate is not trusted by your PC's web browser and you may get a "certificate error". By downloading this certificate from your HoloLens (over USB or a Wi-Fi network you trust) and trusting it on your PC, you can securely connect to your device.
1. **Make sure you are on a secure network (USB or a Wi-Fi network you trust).**
2. Download this device's certificate from the "Security" page on the Device Portal.
   * Either click the **Security** link from the top right list of icons or navigate to: https://<YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>/devicesecurity.htm
3. Install the certificate in the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store on your PC.
   * From the Windows menu, type: Manage Computer Certificates and start the applet.
   * Expand the **Trusted Root Certification Authority** folder.
   * Click on the **Certificates** folder.
   * From the Action menu, select: All Tasks > Import...
   * Complete the Certificate Import Wizard, using the certificate file you downloaded from the Device Portal.
4. Restart the browser.

## Device Portal Pages

Check **Hide providers** to show the **Events** list only.
* **Registered providers**: Select the ETW provider and the tracing level. Tracing level is one of these values:
   1. Abnormal exit or termination
   2. Severe errors
   3. Warnings
   4. Non-error warnings

Click or tap **Enable** to start tracing. The provider is added to the **Enabled Providers** dropdown.
* **Custom providers**: Select a custom ETW provider and the tracing level. Identify the provider by its GUID. Don't include brackets in the GUID.
* **Enabled providers**: Lists the enabled providers. Select a provider from the dropdown and click or tap **Disable** to stop tracing. Click or tap **Stop all** to suspend all tracing.
* **Providers history**: Shows the ETW providers that were enabled during the current session. Click or tap **Enable** to activate a provider that was disabled. Click or tap **Clear** to clear the history.
* **Events**: Lists ETW events from the selected providers in table format. This table is updated in real time. Beneath the table, click on the **Clear** button to delete all ETW events from the table. This does not disable any providers. You can click **Save to file** to export the currently collected ETW events to a CSV file locally.
* **Filters**: Allow you to filter the ETW events collected by ID, Keyword, Level, Provider Name, Task Name, or Text. You can combine several criteria together:
