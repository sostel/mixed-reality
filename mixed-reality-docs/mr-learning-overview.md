# MR Learning Modules

## Overview

The MR Learning Modules are an updated approach to teaching developers how to create applications for the Mixed Reality Platform and devices, based on learnings from the original Academy tutorial series. Some examples of feedback we wanted to address with this new series include:

* Tutorials don't implement or show how to use the Mixed Reality Toolkit
* The tutorials are great for learning how to implement one thing, but not for building an application
* There is not really any UI guidance available

With that feedback in hand, we set out to design a set of tutorials that would not only address the above items, but also will give all developers a useful baseline code template to begin from.
