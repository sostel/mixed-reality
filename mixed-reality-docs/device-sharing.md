# Device Sharing


# Session Sharing

Hololens 2 device can be shared between people, without a need for each person to go through the device setup and create an account. Several people can share a Hololens 2 device and, for convenience, use the same account to log in. 
When a user shares the device (through her login session) with another user, the device prompts the new user to quickly calibrate and personalize the viewing experience. This calibration can be then stored on the device to automatically adjust for quality and comfortable viewing experience in the future, avoiding recalibration. There is no account change between the users in this case.
