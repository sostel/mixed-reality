# Eye tracking on HoloLens 2
HoloLens 2 allows for a whole new level of context and human understanding within the Holographic experience by providing developers with the incredible ability of using information about what users are looking at. This page gives an overview of how developers can benefit from eye tracking for various use cases and what to look out for when designing eye-gaze-based user interfaces. 

## Use cases
Eye tracking enables applications to track where the user is looking in real time. This section describes some of the potential use cases and novel interactions that become possible with eye tracking in mixed reality.
Before getting started, in the following we will mention the [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_Main.html) several times as it provides several interesting and powerful examples for using eye tracking such as quick and effortless eye-supported target selections and automatically scrolling through text based on where the user looks at. 

### User intent	   
Information about where a user looks at provides a powerful **context for other inputs**, such as voice, hands and controllers.
This can be used for various tasks.
For example, this may range from quickly and effortlessly **targeting** across the scene by simply looking at a hologram and saying "select" (also see [Head-gaze and commit](gaze-and-commit.md)) or by saying "put this...", then looking over to where you want to place the hologram and say "...there". 
Examples for this can be found in [Mixed Reality Toolkit - Eye-supported Target Selection](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_TargetSelection.html) and [Mixed Reality Toolkit - Eye-supported Target Positioning](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_Positioning.html).

An additional example for user intent may include using information about what users look at to enhance the engagement with embodied virtual agents and interactive holograms. For example, virtual agents may adapt available options and their behavior based on currently viewed content. 

### Implicit actions
The category of implicit actions closely relates to user intent.
The idea is that holograms or user interface elements react in a somewhat instinctual way that may not even feel like you are interacting with the system at all, but rather that the system and the user are in sync.
For example, one immensely successful example is **eye-gaze-based auto scroll**. The idea is as simple: The user reads a text and can just keep on reading. The text gradually moves up to keep users in their reading flow. A key aspect is that the scrolling speed adapts to the reading speed of the user.
Another example is **eye-supported zoom and pan** for which the user can feel like diving exactly toward what he or she is focusing at. Triggering the zoom and controlling the zoom speed can be controlled via voice or hand input which is important about providing the feeling of control and avoid overwhelming the user (we will talk about these design guidelines in more detail below). Once zoomed in, the user can then smoothly follow, for example, the course of a street to explore his or her neighborhood just simply by using their eye gaze.
Demo examples for these types of interactions can be found in the [Mixed Reality Toolkit - Eye-supported Navigation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_Navigation.html) sample.

Additional use cases for _implicit actions_ may include:
- **Smart notifications:** Ever get annoyed by notifications popping up right where you were focusing? Taking into account where a user is currently paying attention to, you can make it better! Show notifications offset from where the user is currently looking to limit distractions and automatically dismiss them once finished reading. 
- **Attentive holograms:** Holograms that subtly react when being looked at. This may range from slightly glowing UI elements, a slowly blooming flower to a virtual pet starting to look back at you or trying to avoid your eye gaze after a prolonged stare. This may provide an interesting sense of connectivity and satisfaction in your app.

### Attention tracking	 
Information about where users look at is an immensely powerful tool to assess usability of designs and to identify problems in efficient work streams. By now,  eye tracking visualization and analytics are already a common practice in various application areas. With HoloLens 2, we provide a new dimension to this understanding as 3D holograms can be placed in real-world contexts and assessed alongside. 
The [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_Main.html) provides basic examples for logging and loading eye tracking data and for how to visualize them.

Other applications in this area may include: 
-	**Remote eye gaze visualization:** Visualize what remote collaborators are looking at to, for example, ensure whether instructions are correctly understood and followed.
-	**User research studies:** Attention tracking can be used to explore the way novice vs. experts users visually analyze content or their hand-eye-coordination for complex tasks (e.g., for analysis of medical data or while operating machinery).
-	**Training simulations and Performance monitoring:** Practice and optimize the execution of tasks by identifying bottlenecks more effectively in the execution flow.
-	**Design evaluations, advertisement and marketing research:** Eye tracking is a common tool for market research to evaluate website and product designs.

### Additional use cases
- **Gaming:** Ever wanted to have superpowers? Here's your chance! Levitate holograms by staring at them. Shoot laser beams from your eyes. Turn enemies into stone or freeze them! Use your x-ray vision to explore buildings. Your imagination is the limit!	

- **Expressive avatars:** Eye tracking aids in more expressive 3D avatars by using live eye tracking date to animate the avatar's eyes to indicate what the user is currently looking at. It also adds more expressiveness by adding winks and blinks. 

- **Text entry:** Eye tracking can be used as an interesting alternative for low-effort text entry especially when speech or hands are inconvenient to use. 


## Eye tracking API
Before going into detail about the specific design guidelines for eye-gaze interaction, we want to briefly point to the capabilities that the HoloLens 2 Eye Tracker is providing. The [Eye Tracking API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.perception.people.eyespose) is accessible through: `Windows.Perception.People.EyesPose`. 
It provides a single eye gaze ray (gaze origin and direction) to developers.
The eye tracker provides data at about _30 FPS_.
The predicted eye gaze lies within ca. 1.0 - 1.5 degrees in visual angle around the actual looked at target. 
As slight imprecisions are expected, you should plan for some margin around this lower bound value. We will discuss this more below. 
For eye tracking to work accurately, each user is required to go through an eye tracking user calibration.

## Eye gaze design guidelines
Building an interaction that takes advantage of fast moving eye targeting can be challenging. 
In this section, we summarize the key advantages and challenges to take into account when designing your app. 

### Benefits of eye gaze input
- **High speed pointing.** 
The eye muscle is the fastest reacting muscle in our body. 

- **Low effort.** 
Barely any physical movements are necessary. 

- **Implicitness.** 
Often described by users as "mind reading", information about a user's eye movements lets the system know which target the user plans to engage with. 

- **Alternative input channel.** 
Eye gaze can provide a powerful supporting input for hand and voice input building on years of experience from users based on their hand-eye coordination.

- **Visual attention.** 
Another important benefit is the possibility to infer what a user's is paying attention to. 
This can help in various application areas ranging from more effectively evaluating different designs to aiding in smarter User Interfaces and enhanced social cues for remote communication.

In a nutshell, using eye gaze as an input potentially offers a fast and effortless contextual signal - This is particularly powerful in combination with other inputs such as *voice* and *manual* input to confirm the user's intent.


### Challenges of eye gaze as an input
With lots of power, comes lots of responsibility: 
While eye gaze can be used to create magical user experiences feeling like a superhero, it is also important to know what it is not good at to account for this appropriately. 
In the following, we discuss some *challenges* to take into account and how to address them when working with eye gaze input: 

- **Your eye gaze is "always on"** 
The moment you open your eye lids, your eyes start fixating things in your environment. 
Reacting to every look you make and potentially accidentally issuing actions because you looked at something for too long would result in a terrible experience!
This is why we recommend combining eye gaze with a *voice command*, *hand gesture*, *button click* or extended dwell to trigger the selection of a target.
This solution also allows for a mode in which the user can freely look around without the overwhelming feeling of involuntarily triggering something. 
This issue should also be taken into account when designing visual and auditory feedback when merely looking at a target.
Do not overwhelm the user with immediate pop-out effects or hover sounds. 
Subtlety is key! 
We will discuss some best practices for this further below when talking about design recommendations.

- **Observation vs. control** 
Imagine you want to precisely align a photograph at your wall. 
You look at its borders and its surroundings to see if it aligns well. 
Now imagine how you would do that when at the same time you want to use your eye gaze as an input to move the picture. 
Difficult, isn't it? 
This describes the double role of eye gaze when it is required both for input and control. 

- **Leave before click:** 
For quick target selections, research has shown that a user's eye gaze may move on before concluding a manual click (e.g., an airtap). 
Hence, special attention must be paid to synchronizing the fast eye gaze signal with slower control input (e.g., voice, hands, controller).

- **Small targets:**
Do you know the feeling when you try to read text that is just a bit too small to comfortably read? 
This straining feeling on your eyes that cause you to feel tired and worn out because you try to readjust your eyes to focus better?
This is a feeling you may invoke in your users when forcing them to select too small targets in your app using eye targeting.
For your design, to create a pleasant and comfortable experience for your users, we recommend that targets should be at least 2° in visual angle, preferably larger.

- **Ragged eye gaze movements** 
Our eyes perform rapid movements from fixation to fixation. 
If you look at scan paths of recorded eye movements, you can see that they look ragged. 
Your eyes move quickly and in spontaneous jumps in comparison to *head gaze* or *hand motions*.  

- **Tracking reliability:**
Eye tracking accuracy may degrade a little in changing light as your eye adjust to the new conditions.
While this should not necessarily affect your app design, as the accuracy should be within the above mentioned limitation of 2°. 
It may mean that the user has to run another calibration. 


### Design recommendations
In the following, we list specific design recommendations based on the described advantages and challenges for eye gaze input:

1. **Eye gaze != Head gaze:**
    - **Consider whether fast yet ragged eye movements fit your input task:** 
While our fast and ragged eye movements are great to quickly select targets across our Field of View, it is less applicable for tasks that require smooth input trajectories (e.g., for drawing or encircling annotations). 
In this case, hand or head pointing should be preferred.
  
    - **Avoid attaching something directly to the user’s eye gaze (e.g., a slider or cursor).**
In case of a cursor, this may result in the “fleeing cursor” effect due to slight offsets in the projected eye gaze signal. 
In case of a slider, it conflicts with the double role of controlling the slider with your eyes while also wanting to check whether the object is at the correct location. 
In a nutshell, users may quickly feel overwhelmed and distracted, especially if the signal is imprecise for that user. 
  
2. **Combine eye gaze with other inputs:** 
The integration of Eye Tracking with other inputs, such as hand gestures, voice commands or button presses, serves several advantages:
    - **Allow for free observation:** 
    Given that the main role of our eyes is to observe our environment, it is important to allow users to look around without triggering any (visual, auditory, ...) feedback or actions. 
    Combining ET with another input control allows for smoothly transitioning between ET observation and input control modes.
  
    - **Powerful context provider:** 
Using information about where the user is looking at while uttering a voice command or performing a hand gesture allows for effortlessly channeling the input across the field-of-view. Examples include: “Put that there” to quickly and fluently select and position a hologram across the scene by simply looking at a target and destination. 

    - **Need for synchronizing multimodal inputs (“leave before click” issue):** 
Combining rapid eye movements with more complex additional inputs (e.g., long voice commands or hand gestures) bears the risk of moving on with your eye gaze before finishing the additional input command. 
Hence, if you create your own input controls (e.g., custom hand gestures), make sure to log the onset of this input or approximate duration to correlate it with what a user had fixated on in the past.
    
3. **Subtle feedback for eye tracking input:**
It is useful to provide feedback if a target is looked at (to indicate that the system is working as intended) but should be kept subtle. 
This may include slowly blending in/out visual highlights or perform other subtle target behaviors, such as slow motions (e.g., slightly increasing the target) to indicate that the system correctly detected that the user is looking at a target, however, without unnecessarily interrupting the user’s current workflow. 

4. **Avoid enforcing unnatural eye movements as input:** 
Do not force users to perform specific eye movements (gaze gestures) to trigger actions in your app.

5. **Account for imprecisions:** 
We distinguish two types of imprecisions which are noticeable to users: Offset and Jitter. The easiest way to address offsets is to provide sufficiently large targets to interact with (> 2° in visual angle – as reference: your thumbnail is about 2° in visual angle when you stretch out your arm (1)). This leads to the following guidance:
    - Do not force users to select tiny targets: Research has shown that if targets are sufficiently large (and the system is designed well), users describe the interaction as effortless and magical. If targets become too small, users describe the experience as fatiguing and frustrating.
    
## Eye gaze design guidelines

With HoloLens 2, we have the great opportunity to make gaze & commit faster and more comfortable by using eye gaze instead of head gaze. However, eye gaze behaves very differently to head gaze in certain ways and hence comes with a number of unique challenges. In Eye Gaze Design Guidelines, we summarize general advantages and challenges to take into account when using eye tracking as an input medium in your holographic app. In this section, we focus on the specific design considerations for eye gaze & commit. First, our eyes move incredibly fast and thus are great at quickly targeting across the view. This makes eye gaze ideal for quick gaze & commit actions especially when combined with fast commits such as an air-tap or button press.

Do not show a cursor: While it is nearly impossible to interact without a cursor when using head gaze, the cursor becomes quickly distracting and annoying when using eye gaze. Instead of relying on a cursor to inform the user whether eye tracking is working and has correctly detected the currently looked at target, use subtle visual highlights (more details below).

Strive for subtle blended hover feedback: What seems great visual feedback for head gaze can result in terrible, overwhelming experiences using eye gaze. Remember that your eyes are enormously fast, quickly darting across points in your field-of-view. Quick sudden highlight changes (on/off) may result in flickery feedback when looking around. So, when providing hover feedback, we recommend using a smoothly blended-in highlight (and blended-out when looking away). This means that at first you would barely notice the feedback when looking at a target. Over the course of 500-1000 ms the highlight would increase in intensity. While novice users could keep looking at the target to ensure that the system has correctly determined the focused target, expert users could quickly gaze & commit without waiting until the feedback is at its full intensity. In addition, we also recommend using a blend-out when fading out the hover feedback. Research has shown that quick motion and contrast changes are very noticeable in your peripheral vision (so, the area of your visual field where you are not looking). The fade-out doesn't have to be as slow as the blend-in. This is only critical when you have high contrast or color changes for your highlight. If the hover feedback was pretty subtle to begin with, you probably won't notice a difference.

Look out for synchronizing gaze and commit signals: The synchronization of input signals may be less of a challenge for simple gaze & commit, so, don't worry! It is something to look out for in case you want to use more complicated commit actions though that may involve long voice commands or complicated hand gestures. Imagine you look at target and utter a long voice command. Taken into account the time that you needed to speak and the time that the system needed to detect what you said, your eye gaze has usually long moved on to some new target in the scene. Hence, either make your users aware that they may need to keep looking at a target until the command has been recognized or handle the input in a way to determine the onset of the command and what the user had been looking at back then.
