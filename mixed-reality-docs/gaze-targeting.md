# Gaze and dwell
There are lots of different ways to confirm a _commit_ such as combining gaze with _voice_ or _hand gestures_.
There are several user scenarios though, in which users' hands may either be busy or cannot be tracked (e.g., factory workers with oversized heavy duty gloves). 
Voice input may also not be available due to user preferences, social context or loud environments.
As a fallback solution another option to perform a _commit_ is simply to keep staring at a UI element which we refer to as _dwell_.
A _dwell_ can be performed with either head or eye gaze. 
The idea is simple and can be broken down in the following phases: 
1. User starts gazing at a holographic button

2. After a brief onset delay (e.g., 150 ms) some visual feedback animation is started. The onset delay is used to avoid overwhelming the user by immediately popping up feedback all the time.
    - For _eye gaze_, we recommend the following for the design of the visual dwell feedback:
      - **Blend it**: Smoothly blend in the feedback from barely visible at first to fully opaque. This makes the feedback less distracting and overwhleming and nicely aligns with the confidence that the system has that the user really wants to engage with this button.
      - **Pull it in**: Create a visual feedback than decreases in size and moves towards the center of the target, pulling in the user's visual attention. 

3. After a pre-defined dwell duration (e.g., 800 ms), the dwell completes and an associated event is triggered.
    - Provide some finalizing auditory or visual feedback to really bring home that the item got selected now.

# Gaze targeting

All interactions are built upon the ability of a user to target the element they want to interact with, regardless of the input modality. In Windows Mixed Reality, this is generally done using the user's gaze.

To enable a user to work with an experience successfully, the system's calculated understanding of a user's intent, and the user's actual intent, must align as closely as possible. To the degree that the system interprets the user's intended actions correctly, satisfaction increases and performance improves.

## Target sizing and feedback

The gaze vector has been shown repeatedly to be usable for fine targeting, but often works best for gross targeting (acquiring somewhat larger targets). Minimum target sizes of 1 to 1.5 degrees should allow successful user actions in most scenarios, though targets of 3 degrees often allow for greater speed. Note that the size that the user targets is effectively a 2D area even for 3D elements--whichever projection is facing them should be the targetable area. Providing some salient cue that an element is "active" (that the user is targeting it) is extremely helpful - this can include treatments like visible "hover" effects, audio highlights or clicks, or clear alignment of a cursor with an element.

## Target placement

Users will often fail to find UI elements that are positioned very high or very low in their field of view, focusing most of their attention on areas around their main focus (usually roughly eye level). Placing most targets in some reasonable band around eye level can help. Given the tendency for users to focus on a relatively small visual area at any time (the attentional cone of vision is roughly 10 degrees), grouping UI elements together to the degree that they're related conceptually can leverage attention-chaining behaviors from item to item as a user moves their gaze through an area. When designing UI, keep in mind the potential large variation in field of view between HoloLens and immersive headsets.

## Improving targeting behaviors

If user intent to target something can be determined (or approximated closely), it can be very helpful to accept "near miss" attempts at interaction as though they were targeted correctly. There are a handful of successful methods that can be incorporated in mixed reality experiences:

### Gaze stabilization ("gravity wells")

This should be turned on most/all of the time. This technique removes the natural head/neck jitters that users may have. Also movement due to looking/speaking behaviors.

### Closest link algorithms

These work best in areas with sparse interactive content. If there is a high probability that you can determine what a user was attempting to interact with, you can supplement their targeting abilities by simply assuming some level of intent.

### Backdating/postdating actions

This mechanism is useful in tasks requiring speed. When a user is moving through a series of targeting/activation maneuvers at speed, it can be useful to assume some intent and allow *missed steps* to act upon targets which the user had in focus slightly before or slightly after the tap (50ms before/after was effective in early testing).

### Smoothing

This mechanism is useful for pathing movements, reducing the slight jitter/wobble due to natural head movement characteristics. When smoothing over pathing motions, smooth by size/distance of movements rather than over time

### Magnetism

This mechanism can be thought of as a more general version of "Closest link" algorithms - drawing a cursor toward a target, or simply increasing hitboxes (whether visibly or not) as users approach likely targets, using some knowledge of the interactive layout to better approach user intent. This can be particularly powerful for small targets.

### Focus stickiness

When determining which nearby interactive elements to give focus to, provide a bias to the element that is currently focused. This will help reduce erratic focus switching behaviours when floating at a midpoint between two elements with natural noise.
