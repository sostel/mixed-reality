|1. Rotate the headband up to about 20-30 degrees.|![Step One](images/FitGuideStep1.png)|
|2. Push the headband back. Do not pull it back, or manipulate the band behind the hinge, as this can break the band over time.|![Step Two](images/FitGuideStep2.png)|
|3. Turn the adjustment wheel to extend the headband all the way out. Show the user where the band should rest on the forehead, and show them the adjustment wheel.|![Step Three](images/FitGuideStep3.png)|
|4. Hold the headband for the user, and have them grab the arms of the device and place in on their head. Make sure the band rests in the correct spot, and let them tighten the adjustment wheel. Slide the visor back.|![Step Four](images/FitGuideStep4.png)|
|5. The headband should sit at the top of the forehead, just below your hairline, with the speakers above the ears. By looking at them from the front, you should be able to tell that the lenses are centered over their eyes.|![Step Five](images/FitGuideSetep5.png)|


<H1>Cleaning the HoloLens (1st gen) between demos</H1>


- To clean the visor, remove any dust with a bulb-style lens blower (do not use compressed air).
- Lightly moisten a microfiber cloth with a small amount of distilled water or isopropyl alcohol, then use it to wipe the visor gently in a circular motion. Only the visor may be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, or you will damage the rest of the device!
- Clean the rest of the device, including the headband and device arms, with a lint-free cloth moistened with distilled water. You can also use a non-alcohol soap-moistened towelette to clean the headband between uses. Dry any excess moisture before the next participant uses the device.
- Consider bringing extra devices in case a device cannot be sufficiently cleaned between demos.
