# Install the tools

Get the tools you need to build apps for Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets. There is no separate SDK for Windows Mixed Reality development; you'll use Visual Studio with the Windows 10 SDK.

Don't have a mixed reality device? You can install the [HoloLens emulator](using-the-hololens-emulator.md) to test some functionality of mixed reality apps without a HoloLens. You can also use the [Windows Mixed Reality simulator](using-the-windows-mixed-reality-simulator.md) to test your mixed reality apps for immersive headsets.

We recommend installing the Unity game engine as the easiest way to get started creating mixed reality apps, however, you can also build against DirectX if you'd like to use a custom engine.

>[!TIP]
>Bookmark this page and check it regularly to keep up-to-date on the most recent version of each tool recommended for mixed reality development.

| Tool | Description | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ![Windows logo](images/Windows10_logo.png)<br><br><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank">**Windows 10**<br>(Manual install link)</a> | Install the most recent version of Windows 10 so your PC's operating system matches the platform for which you're building mixed reality apps. | **Installing Windows 10** <br> <ul><li>You can install the most recent version of Windows 10 via Windows Update in Settings or by creating installation media (using the link in the left column).<li>See [current release notes](release-notes-october-2018.md) for information about the newest mixed reality features available with each release of Windows 10.</ul> **Enable developer mode on your PC** at Settings > Update & Security > For developers. <br><br> **Note for enterprise and corporate-managed PCs:** if your PC is managed by an your organization's IT department, you may need to contact them in order to update. <br><br> **'N' versions of Windows:** Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets are not supported on 'N' versions of Windows. |
| ![Visual Studio logo](images/visualstudio_logo.png)<br><br><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank">**Visual Studio 2017**<br>(Install link)</a> | Fully-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows and more. You'll use Visual Studio to write code, debug, test, and deploy. | **Workloads to install:** <ul><li>Desktop development with C++</li><li>Universal Windows Platform development</li></ul>**Note about Unity:** Unless you're intentionally trying to install a newer (non-LTS) version of Unity for a specific purpose, we recommend *not* installing the Unity workload as part of Visual Studio installation, and instead installing the 2018.3 LTS stream of Unity as noted below.<br> <br>**Note:** There are some known issues with mixed reality development in Visual Studio 2019 at the moment.  For now, we recommend that you continue using Visual Studio 2017. |
| ![Windows logo](images/Windows10_logo.png)<br><br><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk" target="_blank">**Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0)**<br>(Manual install link)</a> | Provides the latest headers, libraries, metadata, and tools for building Windows 10 apps on HoloLens 2. | To build HoloLens 2 apps, you will need to install the Windows SDK, build 18362 or later.<br> <br> If you are only developing apps for desktop Windows Mixed Reality headsets or HoloLens (1st gen), you can use the Windows SDK installed by Visual Studio 2017. |
| ![Visual Studio logo](images/HoloLensIcon.jpg)<br><br><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2087187" target="_blank">**HoloLens 2 Emulator**<br>(Install link: 10.0.18362.1005)</a><br> <br><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2065980" target="_blank">**HoloLens (1st gen) Emulator**<br>(Install link: 10.0.17763.253)</a> | The emulator allows you to run apps on a HoloLens virtual machine image without a physical HoloLens.<br> <br> This package also includes holographic DirectX project templates for Visual Studio. | See [Using the HoloLens emulator](using-the-hololens-emulator.md) for more information on getting started with the emulator.<br> <br> **Your system must support Hyper-V** for the emulator installation to succeed. Please reference the System Requirements section below for the details. If desired, you can select to install only the templates without the emulator.<br>|
| ![Unity logo](images/unity_logo.png)<br><br><a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">**Unity 2018.3**<br>(Install link)</a> | The Unity game engine is the easiest way to create mixed reality experiences, with built-in support for Windows Mixed Reality features. | We typically recommend the Unity LTS (Long Term Support) stream as the best version with which to start new projects, updating to its latest revision to pick up the latest stable fixes.<br> <br> Current recommendation is to use **Unity 2018.3.x**, which is required for MRTK v2 below, and which will soon become Unity's 2018 LTS build. <br> <br> Some developers may want to use a different version of Unity for specific reasons. For those cases, Unity supports side-by-side installs of different versions. |
| ![MRTK logo](images/MRTKIcon.jpg)<br><br><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases" target="_blank">**Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK v2) for Unity**</a> | MRTK v2 for Unity is an open source cross-platform development kit for mixed reality applications.<br><br> MRTK v2 is intended to accelerate development of applications targeting Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets and the OpenVR platform. The project is aimed at reducing the barriers to entry to create mixed reality applications and contributing back to the community as we all grow. | Learn more about MRTK v2 by visiting the project's <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/wiki" target="_blank">GitHub wiki</a>. |


## Mixed Reality Toolkit

The Mixed Reality Toolkit provides components and features that are intended to accelerate development of applications targeting Microsoft HoloLens, Windows Mixed Reality headsets and OpenVR platform. The project is aimed at reducing barriers to entry to create mixed reality applications and contribute back to the community as we all grow.
* <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit" target="_blank">MixedRealityToolkit</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity" target="_blank">MixedRealityToolkit-Unity</a> - uses code from the base toolkit and makes it easier to consume in Unity.
* <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityCompanionKit" target="_blank">MixedRealityCompanionKit</a> - code bits and components that may not run directly on HoloLens or immersive (VR) headsets, but instead pair with them to build experiences targeting Windows Mixed Reality.

## Setting up your PC for mixed reality development

The Windows 10 SDK works best on the Windows 10 operating system. This SDK is also supported on Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2. Note that not all tools are supported on older operating systems. 

### For HoloLens development

When setting up your development PC for HoloLens development, please make sure it meets the system requirements for both <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements" target="_blank">Unity</a> and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/productinfo/vs2017-system-requirements-vs" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>. If you plan to use the HoloLens (1st gen) emulator, you'll want to make sure your PC meets the [HoloLens emulator system requirements](using-the-hololens-emulator.md#hololens-emulator-system-requirements) as well.

To get started with the HoloLens emulator, see [Using the HoloLens emulator](using-the-hololens-emulator.md).

If you plan to develop for both HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality immersive (VR) headsets, please use the system recommendations and requirements in the section below.

### For immersive (VR) headset development

>[!NOTE]
>The following guidelines are the current minimum and recommended specs for your immersive (VR) headset *development PC*, and may be updated regularly.

>[!WARNING]
>Do not confuse this with the [minimum PC hardware compatibility guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/windows-mixed-reality-minimum-pc-hardware-compatibility-guidelines), which outlines the *consumer PC specs* to which you should target your immersive (VR) headset app or game.

If your immersive headset development PC does not have full-sized HDMI and/or USB 3.0 ports, you'll need [adapters](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs) to connect your headset.

There are currently [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/troubleshooting-windows-mixed-reality) with some hardware configurations, particularly with notebooks that have hybrid graphics.
